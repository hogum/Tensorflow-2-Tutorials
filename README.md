***
In these tutorials, we introduce ourselves to Tensorflow 2 and learn to build some Neural Networks.


## Sections
### 1. Notebooks
- The notebooks are structured and organized into sections. They introduce and build up on how to use Tensorflow 2 from scratch.
- We get a step-wise introduction to tensorflow 2 and example implementations of common neural network Architectures. The notebooks are implementations of the [Tensorflow 2.0 Start Guide]() book.

### 2. Code-Snippets
- The snippets section has example models that show how Neural Networks can be implemented in Tensorflow 2
Some of the models implemented here include:

#### [Regression](https://github.com/hogum/Tensorflow-2-Tutorials/blob/master/code_snippets/01%20regression.py)
